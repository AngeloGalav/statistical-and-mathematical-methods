## Correlation
The correlation has [..]

#### Positive correlation
If $x$ increases, then $y$ increases. 
Whereas if we have negative correlation, this means that if $x$ increases, then $y$ decreases, so they have a different correlation. 

Small correlation => $X$ & $Y$ are not correlated. 
\[See section 6.4.2 of `mml_ch6`\].

## Emperical means
In data, we compute the statitics in relation of the variables that there are [..]

Consider the RV $X$, so $X: \Omega \longrightarrow R$.
If $X$ is a multivariate RV ($X = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_D)$),  each of the random variable of X has its how realization. 

When we compute the statistics of $x$, we are dealing with _empirical statitics_ or _population statistics_. 

$$
x = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum^{N}_{n=1} x_n
$$

$$
x = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum^{N}_{n=1} x_n
$$
[..]

Each couple is statistically indipendet if [..] Same proabbilotu

Usually we make this assumption on the random variable which presents our data

### Conditional indepence
[..]

The length of a random variable is the value of the _standard deviation_.
